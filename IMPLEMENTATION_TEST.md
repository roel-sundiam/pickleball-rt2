# Tiered Page Visit Coin System - Implementation Test

## Test Summary
✅ **Implementation Status**: COMPLETED
✅ **Compilation**: Frontend and Backend build successfully
✅ **TypeScript**: No compilation errors

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Configuration Updates ✅
- Updated `COIN_COSTS` in both backend and shared interfaces
- Added tiered pricing: `PAGE_VISIT_FREE` (0), `PAGE_VISIT_LOW` (1), `PAGE_VISIT_MEDIUM` (2), `PAGE_VISIT_HIGH` (3)
- Maintained backward compatibility with `PAGE_VISIT` (1)

### 2. Route Configuration ✅
- Updated all 25 routes in `app.routes.ts` with appropriate `coinCost` values
- Applied tiered pricing according to documentation:
  - **Free (0 coins)**: Dashboard, Gallery, Court Rules, Admin pages
  - **Low (1 coin)**: Profile, Reservations, Schedule, Members, Payment History, Polls
  - **Medium (2 coins)**: Suggestions, Premium Features, Weekend Payment
  - **High (3 coins)**: Book Reservation, Payment Form, Upload Photo

### 3. Frontend Guard Updates ✅
- Modified `PageVisitGuard` to read `coinCost` from route data
- Added fallback to legacy `PAGE_VISIT` cost for backward compatibility
- Updated insufficient coins handling to show dynamic costs

### 4. Frontend Service Updates ✅
- Enhanced `AnalyticsService.trackPageVisit()` to accept optional `coinCost` parameter
- Updated `PageVisitRequest` interface to include `coinCost` field

### 5. Backend Controller Updates ✅
- Modified `analyticsController.trackPageVisit()` to handle dynamic coin costs
- Added fallback logic: uses frontend-provided `coinCost` or defaults to `COIN_COSTS.PAGE_VISIT`
- Updated coin deduction and transaction logging to reflect actual costs
- Enhanced error messages to show specific coin requirements

## Expected Behavior

### User Navigation Costs
| Page Type | Examples | Cost | Impact |
|-----------|----------|------|---------|
| **Free** | Dashboard, Gallery, Court Rules | 0 coins | Free navigation encourages exploration |
| **Low** | Profile, My Reservations, Schedule | 1 coin | Basic functionality remains affordable |
| **Medium** | Suggestions, Premium Features | 2 coins | Enhanced features cost more |
| **High** | Book Reservation, Payment | 3 coins | Core business actions have premium cost |

### Example User Journey
```
Login (free) → Dashboard (0 coins) → Schedule (1 coin) → Book Reservation (3 coins)
Total: 4 coins (vs 4 coins in old system, but better UX)
```

### Backward Compatibility
- Routes without `coinCost` data fall back to 1 coin (legacy behavior)
- Superadmins continue to pay 0 coins for all pages
- Existing page visit records remain unchanged

## Manual Testing Steps

1. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   cd backend && npm run dev
   cd frontend/pickleball-app && ng serve
   ```

2. **Test Free Pages** (0 coins):
   - Navigate to Dashboard - should not deduct coins
   - Navigate to Gallery - should not deduct coins
   - Navigate to Court Rules - should not deduct coins

3. **Test Low Cost Pages** (1 coin):
   - Navigate to Profile - should deduct 1 coin
   - Navigate to My Reservations - should deduct 1 coin
   - Navigate to Court Schedule - should deduct 1 coin

4. **Test Medium Cost Pages** (2 coins):
   - Navigate to Suggestions - should deduct 2 coins
   - Navigate to Premium Features - should deduct 2 coins

5. **Test High Cost Pages** (3 coins):
   - Navigate to Book Reservation - should deduct 3 coins
   - Navigate to Payment - should deduct 3 coins

6. **Test Insufficient Coins**:
   - Ensure user has < 3 coins
   - Try to navigate to Book Reservation
   - Should show insufficient coins modal but allow navigation

7. **Test Superadmin**:
   - Login as superadmin (username: superadmin, password: Admin123)
   - Navigate to any page - should cost 0 coins

## Database Impact
- **Existing Data**: All existing page visit records remain intact
- **New Visits**: Will use the tiered pricing system
- **Coin Transactions**: Will show specific costs in descriptions (e.g., "Page visit: Book Reservation (3 coins)")

## Monitoring Points
After deployment, monitor:
- User coin balance trends (should be more stable due to free navigation)
- Page visit frequency by tier
- Abandonment rates at high-cost pages
- Overall user engagement levels

## Rollback Plan
If issues arise, the system can be rolled back by:
1. Removing `coinCost` from route data (falls back to 1 coin for all pages)
2. Or reverting the entire implementation to use only `COIN_COSTS.PAGE_VISIT`
